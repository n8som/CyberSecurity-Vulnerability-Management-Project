# OpenVAS CyberSecurity Vulnerability Management Project

<h2>Intro</h2>

Welcome to my lab session today where I'm going to be focusing on cybersecurity vulnerability management. Let's take a look at what I'll be doing.

I will be using Microsoft Azure which gives me the platform to perform all my activities.

First, I will set up my Vulnerability Management Scanner by installing OpenVAS from the Azure marketplace. I will use a weak pre-set configuration for my virtual machine (VM) and SSH into it, waiting for the OpenVAS to deploy.

Once deployed, I log into the web app using the provided default credentials, then immediately change the password for security purposes.

I then proceed to create a client virtual machine. This VM is intentionally made vulnerable for these exercises. It's important to set the VM in the same region and virtual network as OpenVAS for compatibility. We install outdated versions of software like Firefox, VLC Player, and Adobe Reader to make it vulnerable.

Once the vulnerable VM is ready, I configure OpenVAS to perform my first unauthenticated scan against it. I create a new target, host, and task for this process. The scan gives me insights into the VM's vulnerabilities.

Afterward, I start preparations for credentialed scans. This involves making configurations within the VM like disabling the Windows Firewall and User Account Control, enabling Remote Registry, and setting a specific Registry Key.

Similarly, configurations for credentialed scans are also made within OpenVAS. I create new credentials and clone the previous target for this purpose.

I execute the credentialed scan against the vulnerable VM using the newly created credentials. This scan takes longer than the previous one but provides a more in-depth analysis of vulnerabilities.

Once I've identified the vulnerabilities, I remediate them by uninstalling the outdated software and restarting the VM.

Finally, I verify our remediations by re-initiating the credentialed scan and observing the results.

This entire process gives me valuable experience in vulnerability management, from creation to remediation. Remember, this lab is intended for educational purposes and it's crucial to always follow ethical practices in cybersecurity. Thanks for joining me and happy learning!

<h2>Step 1: Prepare Vulnerability Management Scanner</h2>

In Microsoft Azure, access the marketplace and search for "OpenVAS secured and supported by HOSSTED".

Click on "Start with a pre-set configuration" and choose the weakest one.

Proceed through creating a virtual machine process. 

Note: I will need to put the Vulnerability Scanner and VMs in the same region. Also under the Monitoring tab, I disable "boot diagnostics" because I won't need it.

After a couple of minutes, my OpenVAS VM deployed!

After the VM is created, I copy the public IP of the machine from Azure and SSH into it using PowerShell because I am using a Windows machine. MAC users will use Terminal.

This will take a while. Take note of the username and password.

Copy and paste this URL into a new tab and this will bring me to the OpenVAS webserver where I log in and perform vulnerability management.

After logging in, I changed the password to something easier to remember for this lab.

<h2>Step 2: Create Client VM and Make it Vulnerable</h2>

Navigate back to the Azure portal and create a new VM. I make sure to create it in the same Resource Group and Region.

Under the Networking tab make sure it's in the same Virtual Network "OpenVAS-vnet".
