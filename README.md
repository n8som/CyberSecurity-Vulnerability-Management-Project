# CyberSecurity-Vulnerability-Management-Project

Welcome to my lab session today where I'm going to be focusing on cybersecurity vulnerability management. Let's take a look at what I'll be doing.

I will be using Microsoft Azure which gives me the platform to perform all my activities.

First, I will set up my Vulnerability Management Scanner by installing OpenVAS from the Azure marketplace. We use a weak pre-set configuration for our virtual machine (VM) and SSH into it, patiently waiting for the OpenVAS to deploy.

Once deployed, we log into the web app using the provided default credentials, then immediately change the password for security purposes.

We then proceed to create a client virtual machine. This VM is intentionally made vulnerable for our exercises. It's important to set the VM in the same region and virtual network as OpenVAS for compatibility. We install outdated versions of software like Firefox, VLC Player, and Adobe Reader to make it vulnerable.

Once our vulnerable VM is ready, we configure OpenVAS to perform our first unauthenticated scan against it. We create a new target, host, and task for this process. The scan gives us insights into the VM's vulnerabilities.

Afterwards, we start preparations for credentialed scans. This involves making configurations within our VM like disabling the Windows Firewall and User Account Control, enabling Remote Registry, and setting a specific Registry Key.

Similarly, configurations for credentialed scans are also made within OpenVAS. We create new credentials and clone the previous target for this purpose.

We execute the credentialed scan against our vulnerable VM using the newly created credentials. This scan takes longer than the previous one, but provides a more in-depth analysis of vulnerabilities.

Once we've identified the vulnerabilities, we remediate them by uninstalling the outdated software and restarting the VM.

Finally, we verify our remediations by re-initiating the credentialed scan and observing the results.

This entire process gives us valuable experience in vulnerability management, from creation to remediation. Remember, this lab is intended for educational purposes and it's crucial to always follow ethical practices in cybersecurity. Thanks for joining us and happy learning!
